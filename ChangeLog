	* endian.c (Get_Endianness): 
	Renamed endian.h to a2b_endian.h to avoid conflict with external endian.h

2010-07-31  Bill Poser  <poser@khunekcho>

	* binary2ascii.1, ascii2binary.1: 
	Replaced pipe with comma as separator for short and long options.

2008-10-06  Bill Poser  <poser@khunekcho.khunek.poser.org>

	* ascii2binary.c: 
	Updated copyright messages to GPL 3.

2008-03-14  Bill Poser  <poser@khunekcho.khunek.poser.org>

	* binary2ascii.c ascii2binary.c: 
	Changed license to GPL v.3 and updated headers.
	
2007-02-12  Bill Poser  <poser@khunekcho.khunek.poser.org>

	* MachineInfo.c (Print_Sizes): 
	Added wchar_t.
	Added maximim and minimum values.
	Reformatted table.

	*ascii2binary.c binary2ascii.c:
	Miscellaneous code cleanup.

2006-12-19  Bill Poser  <poser@khunekcho.khunek.poser.org>

	* MachineInfo.c:
	Now autoconfigured so that on machines with larger types
	available it will report on them.

	* ascii2binary.1, binary2ascii.1: 
	Added miscellaneous long options that had been omitted.

2006-04-18  Bill Poser  <poser@S010600023f310f85.ca.shawcable.net>
	
	* binary2ascii.c:
	The default value of Delimit_P is now 1. The flag -D|--do-not-delimit
	was added. 

	Floating point numbers are no longer zero-padded by default.

	A new flag -Z disables zero padding.
	
	* ascii2binary.c, binary2ascii.c:
	Both programs now have an optional 'L' flag, which species the locale.
	This allows an ascii2binary | binary2ascii pipeline to be used to
	convert numbers from the format appropriate for one locale to that
	appropriate for another.

	* ascii2binary.c, GetWord.c:
	The thousands separator for the locale is now stripped
	as the word is read, allowing delimited numeric strings
	to be interpreted by strto(f|d|ld).

2006-03-11  Bill Poser  <poser@S010600e0185aee1a.ca.shawcable.net>

	* binary2ascii.c ascii2binary.c: 
	Added GNU long options if supported.

2006-03-08  Bill Poser  <poser@S010600e0185aee1a.ca.shawcable.net>

	* binary2ascii.c: 
	Added -l option, which causes a linefeed to be added after every 0x0A value
	if the size is char, short, int, or long, that is, the sizes that might
	represent a character.

2006-03-03  Bill Poser  <poser@S010600e0185aee1a.ca.shawcable.net>

	* GetWord.c: 
	Replaced call to isspace with direct test for space, tab, NL, and CR
	since under circumstances that I don't understand isspace sometimes
	doesn't work. (And yes, I made sure I tested in the POSIX locale.)

2006-03-03  Bill Poser  <poser@S010600023f310f85.ca.shawcable.net>

	* binary2ascii.c: 
	Added -d option for delimiting output as per locale.
	Now allow precision of 0 that was incorrectly treated as an error.

2005-09-12  Bill Poser  <poser@khunekcho.khunek.poser.org>

	* ascii2binary.c: 
	Added extern declaration of strtold. This declaration is missing
	from stdlib.h when gcc is invoked normally because it is a C99
	extension that is not a standard GNU extension.

2005-09-11  Bill Poser  <poser@khunekcho.khunek.poser.org>

	* ascii2binary.c (main): 
	Added support for long double.

	*binary2ascii.c (main): 
	Added support for long double.

	* MachineInfo.c (Print_Sizes): 
	Added long double.

2.7
Redid exit codes to reflect fine differences making
programs more useful in scripts. Updated the documentation
and French translation to reflect this.

2.4
-s now prints endianness as well as size information for both programs.

2.3
Internationalized. Added French translation.

2.2
Added ability to specify base symbolically as well as numerically to ascii2binary.
Added ability to specify base numerically as well as symbolically to binary2ascii.
Added warnings for incompatible options to binary2ascii.
binary2ascii now defaults to prefixing '0x' to hexadecimal output. The -x flag
	     now turns this off.
