These programs have been developed and tested under GNU/Linux. They should
compile and run in any POSIX-compliant environment.

They are meant to be compiled with gcc. They should compile with other compilers
as well. However, note that some compilers do not support the long long
type, so on some systems it may be necessary to install gcc rather than your
usual compiler.
